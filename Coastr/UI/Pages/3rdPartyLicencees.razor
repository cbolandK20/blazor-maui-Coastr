            SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE<br />
            Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007<br />
            <br />
            PREAMBLE<br />
            The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide<br />
            development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation<br />
            efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and<br />
            open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership<br />
            with others.<br />
            <br />
            The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<br />
            redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The<br />
            fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,<br />
            redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved<br />
            names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<br />
            however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The<br />
            requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<br />
            to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.<br />
            <br />
            DEFINITIONS<br />
            "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright<br />
            Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may<br />
            include source files, build scripts and documentation.<br />
            <br />
            "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the<br />
            copyright statement(s).<br />
            <br />
            "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as<br />
            distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).<br />
            <br />
            "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,<br />
            or substituting — in part or in whole — any of the components of the<br />
            Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a<br />
            new environment.<br />
            <br />
            "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical<br />
            writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.<br />
            <br />
            PERMISSION & CONDITIONS<br />
            Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining<br />
            a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,<br />
            redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font<br />
            Software, subject to the following conditions:<br />
            <br />
            1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,<br />
            in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.<br />
            <br />
            2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,<br />
            redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy<br />
            contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be<br />
            included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or<br />
            in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or<br />
            binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.<br />
            <br />
            3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font<br />
            Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding<br />
            Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as<br />
            presented to the users.<br />
            <br />
            4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font<br />
            Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any<br />
            Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the<br />
            Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written<br />
            permission.<br />
            <br />
            5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,<br />
            must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be<br />
            distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to<br />
            remain under this license does not apply to any document created<br />
            using the Font Software.<br />
            <br />
            TERMINATION<br />
            This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are<br />
            not met.<br />
            <br />

            # Attribution<br />
            <br />
            Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OFL, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font<br />
            Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient<br />
            attribution, so you shouldn't need to do anything additional when using these<br />
            files normally.<br />
            <br />
            We've kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work<br />
            to remove them from files, especially code. They're a great way for folks to<br />
            learn about Font Awesome.<br />
